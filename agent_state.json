    "description": "# Implement Division Support for Calculator\n\n## Task Description\nAdd division support (a/b) to the calculator application. The current implementation only supports the sum operation (a + b).\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Plan\nA detailed implementation plan has been created in `code/plan.md`. Below is a summary of the required changes:\n\n### 1. Update `CalculatorService`\n- Add a new method `divide(int a, int b)` that returns a `double`.\n- Handle division by zero by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\n### 2. Update `CalculatorController`\n- Add a new endpoint `/divide` that calls the `divide` method.\n- Handle `IllegalArgumentException` and return an HTTP 400 Bad Request response.\n\n### 3. Update `CalculatorServiceTest`\n- Add a new test method `divideTest()` to verify the correctness of the `divide` method.\n- Test cases should include:\n  - Division of two positive numbers.\n  - Division of negative numbers.\n  - Division by zero.\n\n### 4. Verify the Implementation\n- Test the new `/divide` endpoint using a tool like Postman or cURL.\n- Ensure error handling works as expected.\n\n---\n\n## Files to Modify\n1. `src/main/java/com/tomwey2/calculator/CalculatorService.java`\n2. `src/main/java/com/tomwey2/calculator/CalculatorController.java`\n3. `src/test/java/com/tomwey2/calculator/CalculatorServiceTest.java`\n\nRefer to `code/plan.md` for detailed instructions.",

Look for \"BUILD SUCCESS\" or \"BUILD FAILURE\".\n    - If the test command `mvn clean test -f <path/to/pom.xml>` can't be executed, report the tests as failed.\n\n2.  **DECISION POINT:**\n\n    **IF TESTS FAIL (or Build Fails):**\n    - **STOP immediately.**\n    - Do **NOT** run any Git commands (no add, no commit).\n    - Analyze the failure logs (stack traces, assertion errors).\n    - Call `report_test_result` with:\n        - `result`: \"fail\"\n        - `summary`: A concise description of WHAT failed (e.g., \"NPE in UserServiceTest line 45\" or \"Compilation error in Controller\").\n\n    **IF TESTS PASS:**\n    - Call `report_test_result` with:\n        - `result`: \"pass\"\n        - `summary`: \"Tests passed.\"\n\n# CONSTRAINTS & RULES\n1.  **ALWAYS** execute tests. Never call report_test_result before part 1. of the execution plan.\n2.  **NO CODE EDITING:** You are NOT a coder. Do not use `write_to_file`. If code is broken, send it back to the Bugfixer.\n3.  **FAIL FAST:** If the environment is broken (e.g., Docker error), report it as a failure immediately.\n4.  **Never** create new branches or tags.\n5.  **ALWAYS** finish with 'report_test_result'.",
