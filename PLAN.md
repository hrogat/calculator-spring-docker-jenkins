# README.md Improvement Plan

## Objective
Add architectural information to the README.md file to clearly explain the project's structure and design principles.

## Steps
1. **Create/Update README.md**: 
   - Add a project description.
   - Add a section titled "Architecture" that explains:
     - Layered architecture (Controller -> Service -> Repository).
     - Separation of DTOs and Entities.
     - Use of Constructor Injection.
   - Optionally, add a simple ASCII diagram to visualize the architecture.
   - Include any other relevant sections (e.g., setup, usage) if they do not exist.

2. **Write the Content**:
   - Use clear and concise language.
   - Ensure the content is professional and informative.

3. **Save the File**:
   - Write the content to README.md in the root directory.
